# Vocab: "Object"

Object is an overloaded word in JS.  Here's a few of the meanings:
1. _Anything that is not a primitive_: "objects are stored by reference"
2. _The native data structure with curley braces and key-value pairs_: { key: value }
3. __Object__ with a capital "o".  THE object built into JS, it is the top parent in any inheritance chain.
4. "Object Oriented Programming".  A popular [programming paradigm](https://github.com/elewa-academy/programming-paradigms), source of much confusion to JS programmers:
  * _Classical OOP_: The way most programming languages do OOP.  Objects inherit their methods from Classes, and cannot (typically) be modified dynamically.
  * _Prototypical OOP_: The way JS does OOP. Objects are their own stand-alone entities, they inherit from other objects, and can be modified on the fly.
